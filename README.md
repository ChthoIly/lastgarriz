This app has been silentely added to an internal black list by Team17. I had no message from them.   
EAC used with HLL does not detect this app as a cheat but send related informations about running apps and/or screenshots when you play. 
  
All binaries have been removed, you can still continue to use this tool after compiling it yourself but this is at your own risk. See more information :  https://github.com/maxensas/lastgarriz/issues/1

### What is Lastgarriz?
Lastgarriz is a third-party tool that offers useful features for Hell Let Loose without interacting with it while playing.

## Features provided :
* Quick access to settings in order to modify hotkeys.
* A feature that allows you to automatically join the server queue when full.
* A feature that allows you to record map activity of your team by taking snapshots when you open in-game map : for post-match analysis.
* An overlay to enable fast conversions for in-game artillery usage : distance meters to elevation milliradians.
* An overlay to enable a rocket crosshair based on approximate in-game measurements.
* An in-game taskbar to show active features.

### Define and use your own shortcuts :
* To configure or close the program, use right click on system tray icon.
* All features have a deep explain on themselves, just leave the mouse hover until a tooltip appears.

### Third party tool usage :
* In order to work correctly, you need to run your game in borderless full screen.
* This tool should not be used in competitive matches outside the map history recorder as they disallow all kind of overlay usage.
* Rocket crosshair feature provide a training tool very useful for finding landmarks, it will never provide skill.
* This tool allocates 90MB of memory in normal use and never more than 200MB, it does not negatively affect in-game FPS.

### Tool's future :
* Lastgarriz will never play for you.
* A server browser using steam API will probably be implemented.

## For further informations :
This program is free, open-source, licenced under BSD-3-Clause License and still in development.
